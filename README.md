# Tweet Intent Analysis

**TweetIntentAnalysis** is a mini-project focused on analyzing customer support interactions on Twitter to identify and evaluate customer intents. The project explores how well AI models classify user intents and provides tools for auditing performance using a manually labeled "golden set."


## Project Goals

- Analyze real-world customer service tweets
- Identify common customer intents (e.g., billing, technical support, upgrades)
- Create a golden set of manually labeled messages
- Evaluate the performance of automated intent classification
- Visualize insights and performance metrics
